          <h2>What I’m about</h2>
        <p>Hannah Donovan makes consumer-facing digital products in music and entertainment. She’s currently leading the team, product and design at Drip, a music start up at Expa NYC. Drip is reinventing fan clubs for the modern musician.
          <p>
Previously, Hannah served as VP, Product Design for Ripcord, a new creative technology studio backed by MTV. She brought her start-up experience to the corporate level by advising on creative strategy, process and team as well as being a hands-on designer.
Before that, Hannah co-founded This Is My Jam in London with incubation from The Echo Nest. When it launched, Jam was significant to the online music landscape as a “slow music service” and something that was very different to competition at the time. Jam was spun out from the Echo Nest in 2013 and continues to see a devoted, engaged user base of music lovers. During the time she was working on Jam full time as their only designer, she also co-ran the business and led marketing / PR besides her daily design duties.
          </p>
          <p>
While running Jam independent of The Echo Nest, Hannah and her business partner also formed a consultancy to bootstrap the business, designing for clients such as MTV.
          </p>
          <p>
Before that, Hannah was the design director at Last.fm. She designed across multiple platforms including web, mobile, desktop software, Xbox and other devices. As part of her graphic design duties she led the brand, look and feel contributing to the website redesign in the run up to the CBS acquisition in 2007. Hannah also led the design team and worked closely with product and leadership. </p>
<p>
Before relocating to London to work for Last.fm, Hannah worked agency-side in Toronto designing websites for youth-focused brands in music, entertainment, fashion and games.
</p>
<p class="mb0">
She’s also a classically trained cellist who loves hip hop & RnB; a scuba diver and downhill skier; pretty into dad jokes and the last person to leave the party.</p>
